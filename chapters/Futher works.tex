\subsection{Integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):} 
    \noindent A promising future enhancement is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve both the accuracy and intelligence of query refinement. By combining a retriever (to fetch relevant context) with a generator (to produce refined queries), RAG enables dynamic query rewriting based on real-time information. This approach can enhance domain-specific understanding, support conversational search, and allow seamless updates as knowledge bases evolve. Implementing RAG would enable the system to generate more context aware, relevant, and adaptive query suggestions making it especially valuable for applications like medical search assistants or intelligent help desks.
   
\subsection{Multi-Language Support:}
   \noindent Another interesting and important feature that we can expand in future is to add the support for multi-language. By integrating multilingual models , the system can process user queries in various native languages and still deliver accurate refinements. This would make the application more inclusive and useful in global contexts, especially in regions where English is not the primary language. Additionally, cross-language retrieval capabilities can be introduced to allow users to search
