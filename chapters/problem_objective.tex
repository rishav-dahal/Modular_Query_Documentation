\noindent This project aims to develop an intelligent and modular system that enhances the effectiveness of search engines by improving how user queries are interpreted and processed. Through the integration of Natural Language Processing techniques, the system seeks to generate more accurate and meaningful queries tailored to both context and intent.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To design and implement a modular query expansion system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
    \item To accurately interpret the user's intent behind search queries for improved understanding.
    \item To refine and expand queries to enhance the relevance of search results.
    \item To adapt query processing dynamically based on domain-specific context and user preferences.
\end{itemize}
