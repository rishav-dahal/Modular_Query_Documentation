\noindent 
In today’s information-driven world, users are often overwhelmed by vast volumes of digital content, making it increasingly difficult to retrieve relevant results from traditional search systems. Despite advancements in search technology, many engines still rely heavily on keyword matching, which fails to account for the nuances of human language and the complexity of user intent. This gap between user expectations and actual search results stems largely from vague or imprecise queries that do not fully capture the user's contextual needs or emotional undertone.\\

\noindent 
Modular Query Refinement for Search Enhancement addresses this challenge by introducing a smart, intermediary API that refines user queries before passing them to the target search engine or knowledge base. Using modular NLP components such as semantic analysis, Topic Modeling and clustering algorithms, the system enhances query clarity and relevance.\\

\noindent 
Its flexible design allows integration across a wide range of platforms and use cases, improving search efficiency and accuracy while reducing irrelevant results. By acting as a contextual filter between the user and backend systems, this API offers a scalable solution to improve the overall search experience.\\
