\subsection{Usecase Diagram}
\noindent A use case diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig:Usecase Diagram} depicts the interactions between users (actors) and a system to achieve specific goals. It shows the relationships between actors and use cases, highlighting the functionalities provided by the system from the user's perspective.

\subsection{Activity Diagram}
\noindent An activity diagram illustrates the flow of control within a system or a specific process. It shows the sequence of activities, actions, and decisions involved in completing a task or achieving a goal. It's useful for modeling business processes or the logic of algorithms.\\ \\

\subsection{Component Diagram}
\noindent A component diagram shows the organization and dependencies among software components in a system. It depicts the physical components (like executable files, libraries, etc.) and their relationships, providing a high-level view of the architecture.\\ \\

\subsection{System sequence Diagram}
\noindent A system sequence diagram (SSD) represents the sequence of interactions between external actors (users or other systems) and a system to accomplish a specific functionality. It emphasizes the message flows and their order between objects over time.\\ \\ \\
