\noindent Traditional search engines often struggle in delivering relevant results because they rely heavily on basic keyword matching. This approach struggles to grasp the true intent behind a user’s query, especially when the query is complex or specific to a particular domain. As a result, users are frequently presented with vague or irrelevant results that don’t align with what they were actually looking for.\\

\noindent A key challenge is the inability of traditional systems to understand the semantics and context of queries. There's often a disconnect between how users phrase their questions and how information is indexed, leading to poor matches. These systems also lack the flexibility to adapt to different user needs or specialized domains, which contributes to longer search times and a frustrating user experience.
