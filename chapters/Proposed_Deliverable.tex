\noindent 
The proposed deliverable for the Modular Query Refinement project involves developing a web-based system that enhances search results by intelligently refining user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system will adopt a modular architecture, allowing independent processing of different refinement stages such as intent detection, context analysis, and semantic enrichment. It will be built using Django for backend development and React for the frontend interface, with NLP models integrated using libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers. Key features of the deliverable are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a modular NLP-driven query refinement system that preprocesses, analyzes, and reconstructs user search queries to improve result relevance.
    \item Integrate semantic analysis tools (e.g., named entity recognition, keyword extraction) to identify and resolve ambiguities in user intent.
    \item Support domain-specific customization modules to adapt query refinement rules and context for various use cases like academic, medical, or e-commerce search.
    \item Design a user-friendly and responsive web interface to allow users to input queries, view refined outputs, and receive improved search results interactively.
\end{itemize}
