\noindent Modular Query Refinement for Search Enhancement is a dynamic web-based application designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of health-related searches. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system extracts key terms from user queries and refines them to deliver more relevant search results.\\
The application processes each query through various refinement techniques, helping users get precise information faster by minimizing irrelevant results and enhancing the overall search experience. A core part of the system is its use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—an unsupervised learning model that identifies topics based on probabilistic distribution, allowing it to adapt flexibly to different types of hidden topics.\\
In addition to LDA, the system also explores other text encoding methods, including TF-iDF, Bag of Words, and BERT, comparing the result of those integrations to optimize keyword generation and improve the relevance of search responses. By refining queries based on contextual relevance, this approach helps search engines become more intelligent and user-focused.\\
